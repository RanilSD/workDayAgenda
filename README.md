# workDayAgenda
this is my 6th version of a work day planner. alot of sleep was lost and time spent with the help of collegues, friends, family, and tutors before things started to work properly. there is still room for improvement if anyone wants to augment the css and make it more engaging

this is a basic work day planner which is very easy to use to help you organize your time wisely.

TO USE THE AGENDA

- click on the time container in which you want to add a task and simply type. 

- press the little kiwi bird on the right of the bar to lock it into the schedual.

- when loading the time will be green for future tasks, the time at hand will turn red, and the past will turn grey(.hopefully you have already completed those tasks)

- to clear just one time slot simply click. delete what is there and then press the kiwi bird on the right to lock it in.

- to clear the whole schedual simply hit the clear schedual button.
